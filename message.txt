(The Thief. By Edgar Allan Poe. 1832)

Listen to your heart	## heart = stdin

The Thief takes my will function thief(will)
The time is sad		## time = "sad"	
My age is nothing	## age = 0
Put silence into my regards	## regards = ""
While my age ain't 33 	## while age != 33
Put my age with the time into my age 	## age = time + age
Put my regards with my will at my age into my regards ## regards = regards + will[age]

Send my regards return regards
